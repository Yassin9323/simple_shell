Now about the magestic project: The Simple Shell

	Firstly, we identified the topics that we need to revise and revist before starting the project.
Then, we put a clear map of the project's structure based on the tasks required baring in mind the time we have to deliver in first deadline.
As we started coding, we made many editions to the code improving it and attacking errors.
I worked with my partner who is a fully cooperative and professional person (Yousra Adel).


	As for the files that this project has:

 1) main.c -------->> This is the entry point of the project that has the rest of the functions called inside it.

 2) shell.h ------->> This file contain all the libraries and the prototypes of functions we created.

 3) reader.c ------>> Its role is to take input(commands) from the user using the getline() function.

 4) tokenizer.c --->> Its role is to split the string from reader.c into tokens to be passed to the execution function.

 5) executer.c ---->> Its role is to execute the tokens and print shell commands results.
