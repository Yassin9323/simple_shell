Let's Talk about our Project ( Simple Shell )

	At first we put a clear map to the project as what we had learned,

my partner who is fully cooperated and profiesional person (Yousra Adel),


	So lets talk about the files that we made : 

 1) Main.c -------->> this is the main function which everything executed by it.

 2) Shell.h ------->> this file contain all the libraries and function's prototype that we used.

 3) Reader.c ------>> its role to take input(commands) from user by (getline() function).

 4) Tokenizer.c --->> its role to despite the string from (Reader.c) into tokens to be executed.

 5) Executer.c ---->> Its role to execute the tokens that we have and print shell commands results.
